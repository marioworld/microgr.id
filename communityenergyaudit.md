***Puerto Rico Community Energy Audit Strategy***

**Executive Summary:**

Local communities in Puerto Rico have an urgent need for more reliable and affordable electricity. Groups like [ACEPR](https://www.acepr.org){:target="_blank"} (Aceleradora de coóperativos de enérgia en Puerto Rico) are empowering communities to take ownership and control of their energy futures, with the creation renewable energy microgrids and other types of resilient electrical systems. 

The first step is to evaluate the energy needs and scope of each community project. ACEPR believes that electrical customers in the community will be best served by a competitive process for grid improvement, in the form of an RFP (request for proposal). This would allow a range of EPCs (Engineer procurement contractors) to apply, ultimately resulting in more available options for the community.

Creating an RFP requires an electrical audit of each community which involves:
* an electrical survey of the existing loads on participating sites
* energy monitors deployed at key points to monitor energy use over time
* an analysis on rooftop solar potential based on satellite / LIDAR imagery and simulation software
* understanding of the most critical loads in a community
* evaluate the need for energy storage (battery backup) or on-site generators, based on a survey of community needs
* an evaluation of energy effiency improvements


**Stategies for Supporting Local Communities**

*Educational Online Resources*

* guides for communities interested in setting up renewable energy projects
* instructions for how to carry out energy audits
* document projects to share as case studies with other communities in the future

*Energy Audit Lending Library*
* provide a collection of physical tools (energy monitors, data loggers, etc) and resources that a community could use to perform their own energy audit.

*Create templates for RFPs based on Energy Audit Results*
* The energy audit results could be used to understand what options exist for a particular scale of electrical demand / size and characteristics of a microgrid
* As more communities go through the process, the templates would improved based on feedback from real-world experiences
