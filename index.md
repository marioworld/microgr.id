**An educational collection of microgrid resources**

I am currently gathering information and resources about microgrids and alternative energy systems. I'm sharing my reseach though this website. 

Check out these sections (still currently in progress):

[How Microgrids Work](/howmicrogridswork/)

[List of Microgrid Control Systems](/microgridcontrollers)

Do you have suggestions for sections you think should be added? Case studies of resources you'd like to share? Get in touch and maybe I can add them!
